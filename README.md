# Upgraded

Reverse metroidvania where you start with only upgrades and have to find normal abilities

- dash instead of walking
- midair jump (walk off platforms) instead of jumping
- dive slam instead of gravity
- big slow projectile wave attack instead of melee

- different areas- color coded
	- white- central
	- green- get walk (allows horizontal positioning, unlimited horizontal movement in midair)
	- blue- get gravity (allows move horizontally while falling)
	- purple- get jump (needs to be after gravity b/c double jump timing in midair can vary)
	- yellow- get attack
	- orange
	- red
- get to """endgame""" area first

## Story

- you're a brain in a jar type thing
- giant eye on screen talks to you, watches through security cams
- try moving- doesn't work- oh i see the problem, instead of starting with basic abilities enabled and needing to find upgrades, you started with upgrades and need to find basic abilities- whatever we'll go with it- try dashing
- more story stuff throughout collecting upgrades
- at end of test you escape destruction, go through back rooms
- boss fight against eye machine- oculomekhane
