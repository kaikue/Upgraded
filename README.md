# Upgraded

Reverse metroidvania where you start with only upgrades and have to find normal abilities

- dash instead of walking
- midair jump (walk off platforms) instead of jumping
- dive slam instead of gravity
- big slow projectile wave attack instead of melee

- different areas- color coded
	- white- central
	- green- get walk
	- blue- get gravity
	- purple- get jump (needs to be after gravity b/c double jump timing in midair can vary)
	- yellow- get attack
	- orange
	- red
- get to """endgame""" area first


## TODO

- basic movement
- camera snaps between rooms
- sound effects (sfxr)
	- dash
	- jump
	- double jump
	- land
- music
